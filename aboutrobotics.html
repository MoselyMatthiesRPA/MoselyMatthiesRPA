<p>Ftc, or the First Tech Challenge, is a robotics competition for highschool students to create a robot to complete a certain set of tasks each year.</p>
<p>This year, the challenge is called centerstage. We put small hexagonal pucks, called pixels, onto a board or in a taped area at the back of the field. We can also earn extra points from hanging off of a set of trusses at the center of the field, or shooting a paper airplane from the back of the field into a specified zone. </p>
